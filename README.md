# Social-Hierarchy-RL

A reinforcement learning paradigm using openAIs multi-agent RL Gym environment to simulate the emergence of a hierarchy among agents as a result of an environment with constrained resources and penalties for competing (fighting) for scarce resources.

The code includes an environment class based on the OpenAI Gym library, a DQN agent class, as well as a training loop.
